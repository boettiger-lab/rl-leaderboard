# rl-leaderboard
Automatically evaluate, score, and visualize submitted RL agents against relevant conservation gyms

## [Take me to your leader(board)](https://boettiger-lab.github.io/rl-leaderboard/html/fishing)

## How to submit an agent:

1) Make a public github repo ([see template](https://github.com/boettiger-lab/leaderboard_template_sb3)) that contains:
	- a .zip of parameters of a SB3-trained agent; naming convention on this .zip is ENV-ALGORITHM-TEAMNAME.zip
	- a requirements.txt file that contains the packages needed to run the agent, notably `gym_*` 

2) Paste the link to clone this repo in [this Google Form](https://forms.gle/tdVmyo4JD7cS4Goo7)
