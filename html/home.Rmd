Welcome to the Conservation Agents leaderboard, where submissions to conservation-based RL environments are evaluated. <br/>

Clicking on Fishing, Conservation, Climate, Wildlife or Epidemics in the navigation bar will bring up the corresponding leaderboard. For each environment, the submissions are ranked according to a performance metric. Some context is also provided on the environment. <br/>

To make a submission to the leaderboard, click on the Submit Agent tab, which will provide instructions from there.
