### fishing-v0 {data-commentary-width=400}

```{r} 
display_env_leaderboard(fishing_leaderboard, 'fishing-v0')
``` 

***

fishing-v0 implements a simple, single species logistic growth-based fishery.

**Observation Space** The agent observes the fish population at that time step.

**Model Dynamics** Dynamics follow a logistic growth model.

**Action Space** The agent selects the amount of fish to harvest with respect to K. In this case, at interval of K/100ths: 0, K/100, K/50, 3K/100, K/25, ...

**Reward Function** The agent is rewarded by the amount of fish harvested at a time step.
